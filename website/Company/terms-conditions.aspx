Whilst every care has been taken to ensure products are problem free and accurate, the ultimate responsibility lies with the client in ensuring that all software is functioning correctly before use.<br> 

Where applications or sites are developed on servers not provided by ITS Gwalior, the client is expected to provide or seek any information, additional software, support or co-operation pertaining to the server required in order for the application to be correctly developed. Where large applications are to be developed, it is the client’s responsibility to provide a suitable testing environment which is identical to the final production environment. <br>

The client is expected to test fully any application or programming relating to a site developed by ITS Gwalior before being made generally available for use. Where "bugs", errors or other issues are found after the site is live, ITS Gwalior will endeavor (but is not obliged to) to correct these issues to meet the standards of function outlined in the brief.
